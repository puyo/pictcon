				<dt class="q">Why is the game called "Pictorial Consequences"?</dt>
				<dd class="a">
					The real life version of this game is actually a sequel to another real life paper game called "Consequences". Consequences is a very similar game. <br><br>

					Players sit in a circle and each is given a long, thin piece of paper. Each player begins by writing a <b>male name</b> at the top of their piece of paper. This male name is generally a one of their friends, a celebrity or a figure from myth or legend. The player then folds the writing so that the next player cannot see the name and hands it to the next player in the circle. <br><br>

					The next player then writes <b>"Met "</b> and a <b>female name</b>. They then also fold over the paper over again so their writing cannot be seen, and pass it on again. <br><br>

					The next player then writes <b>"At "</b> and a <b>location</b>. They then fold over the paper and pass it on. <br><br>

					The next player then writes <b>"He said "</b> and a whatever they would like the male character to have said. They then fold over the paper and pass it on. <br><br>

					The next player then writes <b>"So she said "</b> and a comment they would like the female character to have said. They then fold over the paper and pass it on. <br><br>

					The next player then writes <b>"So he "</b> and <b>an action</b> for male character to do. They then fold over the paper and pass it on. <br><br>

					The next player then writes <b>"And she "</b> and <b>an action</b> for female character. They then fold over the paper and pass it on. <br><br>

					The next player then writes <b>"And the consequence of all this was "</b> and <b>the consequence</b> of the whole story. <br><br>

					That's where the game ends. Everybody unfurls a piece and laughs at the silliness of it all. <br><br>
					So an example of a game might be:<br><br>

					The abominable snowman<br>
					Met Judi Dench<br>
					At the restaurant at the end of the universe.<br>
					He said "Hey honey, why don't you buy me a kebab?"<br>
					So she said "Oh, a wise guy, eh?"<br>
					So he went down to the local shops to buy safety pins<br>
					And she ignored the spider sitting on his head.<br>
					And the consequence of all this was that there were 7 less birds flying South that year.
