				This version of Pictorial Consequences was written by Gregory McIntyre and Lucy Ding. It originally started as a project for Greg to teach Lucy how to code in Java.

				Lucy loves word games. She always has.
			</p>
			<p>				
				She learned Pictorial Consequences from a book and immediately tried to con as many of her friends as possible into playing the game. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But friends are not always available or ready to play pointless, although extremely fun, games in the small hours of the morning. Understandably, Lucy considered it a great pity that she could not play Pictorial Consequences with her internet friends as well. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				Thus when Lucy wanted to learn to program in Java, Pictorial consequences seemed like an excellent project to start on. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A medical student by trade and not well versed in programming, Lucy wasn't exactly the brains trust of this project. She was, however, far more enthuaiastic about it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Lucy programmed where she could and poked and prodded Greg where she had to.

				<p>
					Software Engineering student by trade, Greg is the
					know how behind this project.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project was completed due to the following
					scenario: Lucy looks at Greg with big puppy dog
					eyes and says, "Will you help me with Pictorial
					Consequences?/Teach me how to do sockets!/Make it
					work!/Greeeeg... it doesn't work.../I liiike
					you!". Greg sighs, stops what he's doing and
					spends the next few hours in a nightmare land of
					unexplained socket exceptions, concurrency
					control, race conditions, bizarre Java API
					decisions and crying girlfriends.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his spare time, Greg likes to 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>write lists,</li>
					<li>roleplay,</li>
					<li>code in Ruby, XSLT and C++,</li>
					<li>play computer games repeatedly (the good ones, I tells ye!),</li>
					<li>correct other people's grammar,</li>
					<li>split large paragraphs up.</li>
				</ul>
